**Context**
- This is a prototype for a game that I'm working on.
- This is meant to be a Pokemon-style RPG battle.
- The concept is if the player selects an action, a minigame will happen for the player to engage in.
- The minigame will help determine the output of the action (for example, the damage done from an attack).
- The player will be able to level up and learn new moves.
- The point is that the player fights enemies endlessly.

**How to use**
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS SO HAS NOTHING BUT THE CODE FOR SHOW!

**Known Problems**
- Under the settings() function, the player can change the name of 2 players but that does not get reassigned in the variables.
