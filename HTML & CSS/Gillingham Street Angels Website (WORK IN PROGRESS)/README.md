**About The Project**

- This Project is meant to be for a college project to work on a website for my local charity.
- I used JavaScript to work on my own JavaScript framework, which specialises in dynamic UI elements.
- Worked with JSON files to implement a miniature backend for holding and presenting the dynamic UI elements.

** Known Issues **

- The website doesn't have mobile support yet.
- The responsiveness of the website may look weird on larger monitors
